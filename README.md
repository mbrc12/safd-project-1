# Project - 1 (Statistical Analysis of Financial Data)

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook we developed for our SAFD Project - 1. The notebook serves as both the blog/report as well as the code/demonstration for our project. 

**NOTE**: Since the notebook contains some LaTeX, and the Github displayer for Jupyter Notebooks doesn't handle LaTeX well, it looks a bit ugly. It is recommended to download the notebook and view it on a Jupyter instance. We have added a **pdf** file for convenience (generated using Jupyter), but it doesn't look as good as the original one.

**Disclaimer:** The content of this report and the product made is only meant for learning process as part of the course. This is not for use of making publication or making commercialisation without mentor’s consent. My contribution won’t demand any claim in future for further progress of Mentor’s development and innovation along the direction unless there is a special continuous involvement.
