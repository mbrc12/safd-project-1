# Project - 1 (Statistical Analysis of Financial Data)

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook we developed for our SAFD Project - 1. The notebook serves as both the blog/report as well as the code/demonstration for our project. 

**NOTE**: Since the notebook contains some LaTeX, and the Github displayer for Jupyter Notebooks doesn't handle LaTeX well, it looks a bit ugly. It is recommended to download the notebook and view it on a Jupyter instance. We have added a **pdf** file for convenience (generated using Jupyter), but it doesn't look as good as the original one.
